If the curse is not removed within 24 hours, the target becomes fully petrified, immediately dies, and returns through the Vaean Archway if able. The curse becomes cured when the target dies, whether from the curse itself or from something else killing them.

Incensed Workbench,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,5,,,,,"(Pre-req: Kit Creation, Maker’s Style: Slow and Steady, and any Journeyman Alchemist bundle) (Talent) (To Use: 5 mins RP). Also costs 1 Crafting Kit and can only be used on permanent Workbenches. You set up experimental alchemical candles with a magical fragrance that eases the mind and makes time seem slower. For the next 3 times the workbench is used to make an item, the crafter may use the Slow and Steady ability even if they don’t actually have it. If the crafter already knows the Slow and Steady ability, then no additional time is added to the final crafting time of the item and any augments applied to it. After 3 items have been made at the workbench, a sudden but inevitable alchemical backlash flash freezes it, making the workbench itself count as broken until repaired (workbenches count as Novice items under no bundle for the purposes of repairing them, so it takes 10 minutes to fix with General Repair for instance)."
Augment: Dastardly Traps,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,6,,,Journeyman Hazards bundle,,"Can only be used when crafting a Guile trap device or booby trap device.

Augment: Telescopic Device,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,3,,,any Journeyman Engineer bundle,,"Can only be used when crafting a device. Adds +10 minutes and +4 pool to the item’s final crafting costs. The device can fold in on itself to greatly reduce its size when not in use.

Augment: Smelting,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,5,,,Any Journeyman Smith bundle,,"Can only be used when crafting a weapon, shield, or piece of armor. Adds +15 minutes and +6 Pool to the item’s final crafting costs. When you use this augment, you create a weapon, shield, or piece of armor that has two different properties. The two properties must both be able to be put on the item’s chosen material (metal, leather, or wood). Properties from different tiers may be combined this way. The base time to make the final product is whichever of the two properties has the highest base crafting time, and the two properties’ base Pool point costs and base component costs are combined (abilities or items that affect time, Pool, and component costs apply after the two properties have been combined). The Hardness of the final product is whichever one has the highest Hardness, unless stated otherwise (if both properties say to use the other one’s Hardness, then just use the one with higher Hardness as normal). If properties have Strength requirements, they are also combined (if a property has an alternative Strength requirement, it does not override the other property’s requirements). Because only one item is being made, any additional augments being used on the final product must be used once to affect all of the properties involved. If you use this augment to add a property to an item while you are Remaking it, you must pay the full base time, Pool, and component costs of the new property. Despite the name of this ability, its effects do in fact work on non-metal items. Click For Table of Contents"

The workbench also gains a cache of 10 surplus components which can only be accessed if the user already knows the Jury Rig ability. These surplus components can be used as any tier (up to Very Rare) and any type component for the Jury Rig effect only. When all 10 surplus components are spent (it is a cache of 10 to be split between everyone who crafts there) or 3 items have been made at this workbench, the workbench itself becomes broken and cannot be used until repaired (workbenches count as Novice items under no bundle for the purposes of repairing them, so it takes 10 minutes to fix with General Repair for instance)."
Augment: Aetheric Scrolls,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,6,,,"Literacy Elatum, Augment: Foreign Scrolls, and Journeyman Sources bundle",,"Can only be used when crafting a scroll with Augment: foreign Scrolls.

Scrolls with this augment that are written in Elatum grant you access to the power to use off your own pool and/or RP time for 30 minutes when invoked instead of the normal 1 free invokable use. All limits on usage of the scroll skill, such as “once per period” or “once per event,” must still be followed."
Augment: Create Tapestry,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,6,,,Journeyman Implements bundle,,"Can only be used when crafting a talisman.

A tapestry has the same effect as its talisman form, but it affects all characters within a Bomb of the physrep (including the holder). If the talisman needed to be invoked, then anyone touching the tapestry may invoke it to give its effects to all characters within Bomb radius of it. The physrep for a tapestry must be a length of cloth with some symbol, icon, or pattern on it that can either be held, standing on its own like a flag, or hung up (the physrep can have other mechanical effects, such as also being used for a Cleric’s Raise Banner)."
Create Verge,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,5,,,Journeyman Implements bundle,,"(To Use: RP time varies, requires an existing wand or talisman) This talent can only be used while a willing character (including yourself) is making a weapon, spell focus, or shield (the talent’s activation time is equal to how long it takes to make the weapon, spell focus, or shield). You take an existing wand or talisman and combine it into the weapon, spell focus, or shield being made, creating a verge. Verges function like normal items, but they also use the abilities of the implement inside them, essentially allowing a weapon/spell focus/shield and talisman to be wielded in the same hand. The talisman’s Hardness becomes irrelevant; only the other item’s Hardness is used for the verge. A weapon or spell focus can only be a verge with 1 implement at a time. One implement can be used to make similar verges for up to 2 fist weapons at once. Throwing weapons and arrows/bolts cannot be made into verges. The added talisman takes up an enhancement slot. If you have Remake, you can use it to add a wand or talisman to an existing weapon, spell focus, or shield. This talent can also be used to create verges out of musical instruments. Since most musical instruments do not have mechanical rules effects, they may be made into verges using this skill without having to first be crafted or using Remake (using the talent this way takes 5 minutes per tier of the talisman to be combined). The Hardness of an instrument-verge is equal to the talisman’s Hardness (unless the instrument does have a Hardness, at which point that should always be used instead). If you have the skill Marvels, you can use this talent or Remake to add a wand or talisman into an existing firearm or one that is being crafted, which follows all the same rules as a weapon-verge. You do not need to know how to make the target item when using this talent with Remake. Click For Table of Contents"
Inscribed Workbench,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,5,,,"Kit Creation, any Journeyman Inscriptionist bundle",,". Also costs 1 Crafting Kit and can only be used on permanent Workbenches. You inscribe motivational words and quotes on the workbench, instilling those who work there with a sense of dedication and purpose. The next 3 times the workbench is used to make an item, the crafter heals 2 points of Steam or Aether once the item is finished (their choice). In addition, if the crafter has either the Rally or Meditate talents, they may use those talents while making items at the workbench. After 3 items have been made at the workbench, the motivational words get twisted by Oksani and causes the person who made the last item have some terribly ironic accident that causes the workbench itself to be broken until repaired (workbenches count as Novice items under no bundle for the purposes of repairing them, so it takes 10 minutes to fix with General Repair for instance)."
Polymerization,Journeyman,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,5,,,Journeyman Sources bundle,,"Can only be used when crafting a spell focus. Adds +15 minutes and +6 Pool to the item’s final crafting costs. When you use this augment, you create a spell focus or wand that has the properties of two different items. Properties from different tiers may be combined this way. The base time to make the final product is whichever of the two properties has the highest base crafting time, and the two properties’ base Pool point costs and base component costs are combined (abilities or items that affect time, Pool, and component costs apply after the two properties have been combined). The Hardness of the final product is whichever one has the highest Hardness, unless stated otherwise (if both properties say to use the other one’s Hardness, then just use the one with higher Hardness as normal). If properties have any requirements, they are also combined (if a property has an alternative requirement, it does not override the other property’s requirements). Because only one item is being made, any additional augments being used on the final product must be used once to affect all of the properties involved. If you use this augment to add a property to an item while you are Remaking it, you must pay the full base time, Pool, and component costs of the new property. Despite the name of this ability, its effects do in fact work on non-plastic items."

Complex Patterns,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,9,,,,,"When you cast a rune of journeyman level or lower, you may now cast it into a rune which you cast previously that is of the same type (Item, Area, Personal). These runes now count as occupying the same temporary Rune Slot. If these runes are made Permanent, then they count as occupying the same Enhancement slot. This does not allow for a character to benefit from the effects of the same rune twice. Passive bonuses to these runes, such as from “Reinforced Weave” or “Nexial Patterning,” only apply to the individual rune it was used with. Each purchase of this skill allows you to add an additional rune of journeyman or lower into the same rune, up to a maximum of 3 runes total in one slot."
Crafted Runes,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,6,,,,,"You can now use components in addition to or in lieu of pool cost when casting a Rune (This cannot reduce or modify the cost from Nexial Patterning). Each component rarity counts as 1 pool point, but a minimum of 1 point must still be spent from your pool. In addition to this, when using “Long-Handed Runic Casting” You may substitute the additional pool cost for a Rare or Very Rare Component.

The additional augments must follow all rules as if they were being cast normally, and cannot exceed limits set by skills, such as the addition of uses of “Long Handled Runic Casting” granted by “Rune Weaving.” This can be used on permanent runes."

You can only add a skill that is on the list below. Having this skill on a permanent item does not count as knowing it for the purpose of prerequisites. As per normal rune rules, the wielder can only benefit from one of these runes at a time, and in addition to this a wielder must spend 5 minutes bonding with the item to gain the benefits of this rune. This Rune is Permanent and cannot be dispelled; an effect which would dispel this rune instead suppresses it for 10 minutes, or for 1 hour if the dispel effect was “greater”."
Rune of Power,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,8,,,,,"You may now choose to add powers to an item as a Rune. In addition to pool and time costs, this rune costs 1 very rare Mineral component per tier of the power to allow the wielder of the item to cast said power off their own pool.

Rote,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,9,,,,,"You have become so experienced at casting rituals that it has become a rote task for you. You are capable of casting rituals while doing any other activity, even while using other abilities, fighting, and taking damage. You no longer have to concentrate on casting rituals or risk being interrupted unless something actively prevents you from casting (going into your death count, Incapacitate, Imprisonment, Silence, Paralyze, Constrict, Pain, Stun, etc.). You must still continue RPing the casting of the ritual, but you can work those other actions into the RP with no issue. Any items or abilities that give you new options to use while casting a ritual can also be used while doing any other action, so long as you are still “casting.” You can still only cast one ritual at a time.

Grand Ritual of Permanency,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,1,,,,,"(To Use: 7 Aggravated Aether, 2 Very Rare Animal, 2 Very Rare Plant, & 2 Very Rare Mineral components, 25 minutes) When you complete this ritual, then the next arcane non-rune ritual you complete within the period has its duration changed to permanent. You must be the ritual leader to make it permanent, not just a participant. Grand rituals cannot be made permanent this way. If it doesn’t have a duration, it can’t be made permanent this way. If the ritual gives you an invokable ability and lasts until it's used, then when it becomes permanent you can invoke it once every period instead (the actual effect which you invoke does not become permanent), but you may recast the ritual normally to gain the use again. If the ritual involves a choice made by the caster, that choice cannot be changed unless the ritual is cast and made permanent again. If the ritual creates an item, the item is permanent (any effects the item causes is not), and if using it would destroy it, it instead becomes inert until the start of the next period. If an ornament is used when casting the ritual, the ornament effects become permanent as well, but the ornament is Destroyed beyond repair in the process. If no ornament was used originally on a permanent ritual and you want to add the ornament to it, you must perform only this ritual again on the target, not both this one and the ornament’s ritual (the ornament is still Destroyed).

This doesn’t kill it and it is able to return to the world again however it got here to begin with. Against boss level creatures, you must have been fighting them for 1 minute first. If this spell is used on a creature while already on its home plane, it has no effect (this includes divine Nature Beings on Rowanon). If cast on a character who is possessed by a Whisperer Pact, only the possessing creature is sent back, or if they are already on their home plane, the possession is merely dispelled. Divine or void entities in sentient items cannot be sent back this way. The cost of this ritual cannot be reduced and you can only have 1 latent use of Banishment on you at a time.

Give target Lich Card, costuming, and claws (target can also use a staff). Duration: 3 hours. Once the drudge goes into second stage death count, is dispelled, or duration runs out, the target returns to their normal stats and has the same Steam and Aether from right before they were drudged, and they return to being a corpse or to whatever stage of Death Count they were in when raised. Can be dispelled by caster at will. A helpful chart has been created so that you can print out this list for your drudge’s convenience. Once the Lich drudge dies or the drudge is dispelled, it may not be raised again in this way. Efficiencies cannot be applied to this skill.

Architect of the Body,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,7,,,Jar of Organs and Soul Infusion,,"(To Use: 1 minute RP, and between 2-10 Aggravated Vaea and 1-5 Aggravated Steam (from you or another willing target)) Reanimates are cobbled together dead bodies, which have life forcibly shoved into them, bringing them somewhere between life and unlife. Must be used on a mortal or nature creature in any stage of death count or past 3rd stage. Choose up to 2 arms, 2 legs, 4 sensory organs, 4 internal organs, 5 chunks of skin, and 5 chunks of brain from your body bag, and 1 Animus Vial (at minimum requires 1 of each). You may also add up to 4 engineered implants that you have, using “Implant/ Extract Enhancement.” Target gains all abilities from the body parts and implants, and becomes a Reanimate. This is a template that they get along with their normal abilities. The amount of Vaea and Steam donated is multiplied by 5 and added to the body’s Vaea and Steam to create the Reanimate’s pools. Reanimates have the racial ability “Lost Aether Connection: You cannot use Aether or cast spells or rituals. You may use your soak and natural armor against spells as well as physical damage.”  Reanimates are constructs, not mortals. They also have the following abilities: “Long claws- You grow long claws which benefit from pugilist proficiencies,” and “Cranial Scar Tissue- You are immune to Greater and normal Mind, Fear, Terror, Pain, and Incapacitate effects.” Unlike drudges, Reanimates are not innately controlled by their master, for this reason there is no limit to the amount of reanimates you can make at one time. To have some control, you can inscribe 1 basic guideline per brain chunk that you use, acting like “implant command.”  The Re-animate cannot act against what the original body would do. Being forced into doing so causes the Reanimate to enter a “Rampage” for 1 minute. Reanimates see everything as brand new and are often gullible. They are easily surprised, scared, and confused, causing them to react violently, until the cause of their discomfort is gone. Reanimates can last up to 3 periods, although can be dispelled at will by the body, who instantly drops into 3rd stage death count. When the re-animate ends or is killed past 3rd stage, target body re-enters death count where it was stopped, and all body parts used in its creation are destroyed. Reanimate costuming is represented by stitch marks on the face or body."

If the concoction causes physical effects or damage, it will still be obvious that you are not taking those effects, but for ones that don’t have visual giveaways, no one will know.

It also costs 4 crafting kits to establish either a 10-foot radius area outside, or one full room/hallway while inside. It costs no crafting kits if that area includes a permanent workbench. You take the time setting up alchemical incense sticks drawn from the chosen doses in your possession. These sticks are stationary objects with Hardness 1 and must have Area Notes explaining their effect. The concoction used may be of any delivery method, but the zone always counts as a gas concoction for the purposes of defenses. The effects of that concoction are applied to all characters within the incense zone. If the concoction has a duration, it is instead constantly active in the zone and ends on a character when they leave the zone.

When activating this raygun, the wielder can spend +3 Aether and say the command phrase, “Ex Terra Vox Astrum, [type of raygun] Activate!” Doing so makes this activation a “Greater” attack. Additionally, if the raygun has an effect with a duration, the wielder may sustain that effect as if concentrating on a spell, making the duration last until their concentration is broken.

If the user does have the appropriate ability, then the device costs 1 less Pool point to activate instead for those three uses per Period.

Clockwork Integration,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,5,,,Remake,,"You may use “Remake” on mortal clockworks that are willing, immobilized, or “Incapacitated.” The only thing you can do while using “Remake” on a Mortal clockwork this way is to add or remove engineer devices with the “Integrate Device” augment.

For example, soaking a Silverwood shard in a crucible of Vile will turn it into a Blightwood shard.

Smelt Hybrid Shard/Sliver,Master,CRAFTING AND LABOR,Passives,5,,,,,"Can only be done at a workbench (it does not need to have an affinity crucible attached to it). This talent combines two different affinity shards or slivers into one shard or sliver that counts as both. When an item refers to the affinity shard/sliver used in its creation, it uses the effects of both affinities as appropriate. If the item’s damage type is based on the affinity material used, the user chooses one of the damage types each time it deals damage. If it requires you to have a certain amount of affinity levels, you can only use the effect of the affinity you have those levels in. The two affinities combined this way cannot be opposites of each other. You may also use this talent to separate a hybrid shard or sliver into its two base materials. You can combine up to 6 slivers or separate up to 3 hybrid slivers with one use of this talent. Additionally, when you use this talent to combine Ifritite-Obsidian or Galacium-Plasmite, you may choose for the shard or sliver to instead become Vulcanite (Forge) or Eye-of-the-Storm (Storm) respectively. If an item requires the user to have a certain number of levels of an affinity before it can be used, a Forge or Storm item requires the user to have those levels in both Fire and Earth or both Ice and Lightning as appropriate. Finally, this talent can also be used to create Prism shards or Prism slivers. This is done by combining one shard or sliver as appropriate of every affinity at the same time (Diamond, Aonite, Ifritite, Obsidian, Aethermarble, Silverwood, Darksteel, Ironwood, Galacium, Plasmite, Opal, and Blightwood).

If an item does not have this augment on it, its Masterwork value is 0. Weapons deal additional damage equal to their Masterwork value (the damage stacks if using a Masterwork bow/crossbow with Masterwork arrows/bolts).
